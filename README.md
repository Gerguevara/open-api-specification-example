# Swagger & OpenAPI Demo Project

This is a demo project created to showcase how **Swagger** and the **OpenAPI Specification** work together, and to highlight the different options we can use when designing and documenting APIs.  

The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple example that demonstrates:
- How to define API endpoints using OpenAPI.
- How to visualize and interact with the API documentation through Swagger UI.
- Different ways to structure and customize an API specification.

---

## 🚀 Features
- OpenAPI specification file (`openapi.yml`) as the single source of truth.
- Swagger UI integration to generate interactive documentation.
- Example models and endpoints for demonstration purposes.
- Options to explore validation rules, request/response schemas, and error handling.
